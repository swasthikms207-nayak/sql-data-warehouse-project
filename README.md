# Data Warehouse SQL Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Data Warehouse using SQL Server**, focusing on transforming raw source data into structured **fact and dimension tables** for efficient querying.

The project emphasizes **ETL logic, dimensional modeling, and SQL best practices**, suitable for data engineering and database-focused roles.

## 🏗️ Project Design
The data pipeline is organized into the following layers:

### 🔹 Source Layer
- Raw transactional or source data
- Loaded without transformations
- Serves as the entry point for the pipeline

### 🔹 Staging Layer
- Temporary holding area for source data
- Data cleaning and standardization
- Handling null values, duplicates, and data type corrections

### 🔹 Data Warehouse Layer
- Fact and Dimension tables
- Star schema design
- Optimized for analytical queries
